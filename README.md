# ESP32-MAC-scanner
This code enables an ESP32 device to scan/detect MAC addresses. Scanning takes place in monitor mode, which means that devices do not have to be in the same network as the ESP. You may upload this code to an ESP32 using the [Arduino IDE](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/installing-the-esp32-board-in-arduino-ide-windows-instructions/). 
The code can be used to measure the number of active devices in a smart home or to react to your own MAC address in a certain way.
